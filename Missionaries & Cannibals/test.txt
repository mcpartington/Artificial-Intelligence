|The goal of this program is to compute the best      |
|path to move all of the cannibals and the            |
|missionaries from one side of the river to           |
|the other. Our start and goal states are as follows: |
|Start State: [             |   : B|   M M M C C C ]] |
|Goal State:  [ M M M C C C |B  :  |               ]] |
|                                                     |
|To save space, we will represent the missionaries and|
|cannibals with numbers. Example: [ 3 3 -1- | 0 0 ]   |
|represents the goal state. The '-1-' represents the  |
|boats position. It is on the left shore when it is to|
|the left of the '|', and it is on the right shore    |
|when it is to the right of the '|'. Enjoy!           |

*We have found our goal!* Here is our path:

=======================================================
The following are the states taken to get to the goal state:
1  State:[ 0 0 | -1- 3 3 ]
2  State:[ 1 1 -1- | 2 2 ]
3  State:[ 0 1 | -1- 3 2 ]
4  State:[ 0 3 -1- | 3 0 ]
5  State:[ 0 2 | -1- 3 1 ]
6  State:[ 2 2 -1- | 1 1 ]
7  State:[ 1 1 | -1- 2 2 ]
8  State:[ 3 1 -1- | 0 2 ]
9  State:[ 3 0 | -1- 0 3 ]
10 State:[ 3 2 -1- | 0 1 ]
11 State:[ 3 1 | -1- 0 2 ]
12 State:[ 3 3 -1- | 0 0 ]
--------------------------------------------------------
Total cost of moves from start to finish: 85
Total number of moves: 12

I hope you've enjoyed watching this program find the
best way to move the missionaries and cannibals safely 
from one side of the river to the other. Take care!


 P.S. If you've skipped and exited early, please run the
